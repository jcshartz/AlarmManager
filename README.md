# AlarmManager #

A test application using the [AlarmManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager)
class. 

**This is a (very early) work in progress.** I intend for this project to *eventually* serve both as
a copy-and-paste resource and an educational tool for others. For now it is my educational tool as I
work through the ins and outs of Android.

### Planned Features ###

The planned features for this project can be found in the TODO file until I do it in a better way. 
I am looking for something to integrate with GitHub as a feature tracker and as something to use with 
planning out development.  

### License ###

We will go with the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) licence. Basically feel free to use 
any of my code from this project for open source, business, or any other ventures. I just will not 
guarantee that it will work nor do I take responsibility for its failure. Keep in mind that I do not
take ownership for any code that was created by others i.e. any Android code or the like.
