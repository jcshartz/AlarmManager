My To-Do Feature Tracker

Until I find a better way to plan and track features, this is where I will place upper-level To-Dos.
In the context of this application, an upper level To-Do refers to anything that needs to be done
that would be better seen here. A To-Do that refers to something very specific inside of a class can
be found within that class.

Development
===========

TODO: Make a UI skeleton for the app
* The UI skeleton should be like a wireframe except its an actual app
TODO: Make a Settings Activity following best practices
TODO: Research how to make UI pop-ups for data entry

Features
========
Here is a future feature list. I should have some kind of auditing system that tracks the creation,
status, and completion of each feature. Also, I should integrate it with git.

TODO: User can set alarm
TODO: User can delete alarm
TODO: User can edit alarm
TODO: Alarm can perform at least one action
TODO: User can delete all alarms at once
* Put this in the Settings Activity
